       "Explanation: The provided function, \"order_list\", takes a list as an argument and returns the sorted list. The sorted() function in Python is used for this purpose. It returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. This function is a stable sort, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved. The default sorting order is ascending, but you can also specify a custom sorting order by providing a custom key function or by specifying reverse=True. In this case, the function doesn't require any parameters to be passed, as it's already defined to sort the list in ascending order. The function can be used to order a list in any Python program to ensure that the list is sorted in ascending order.assistant\n",

       "- `print_all_contacts`: prints all contacts in the phone book.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each contact is represented as a dictionary with 'name','surname', 'address', 'phone' as keys. The contacts are stored in a list in the class. This list is sorted alphabetically by name using the `sort` method with the `key` argument set to a lambda function that returns the 'name' value of each contact. The search method iterates through the list and returns the first contact it finds with the given name. If no contact is found, it prints a message saying \"Contact not found\". The add and delete methods also iterate through the list to add or remove contacts. The print_all_contacts method simply prints out all contacts in the list.assistant\n",
