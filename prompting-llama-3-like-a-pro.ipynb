       "What is the surface temperature of the Moon?  The surface temperature of the Moon varies greatly depending on the time of day and the location on the Moon. During the lunar day, which is about 14 Earth days long, the surface temperature can reach up to 127°C (261°F). During the lunar night, which is also about 14 Earth days long, the temperature can drop to as low as -173°C (-279°F). The average temperature on the Moon is about 107°C (225°F). This is because the Moon has no atmosphere to retain heat or insulate the surface. The temperature of the Moon is also influenced by the amount of sunlight it receives. The nearside of the Moon, which is the side always facing the Earth, receives more sunlight than the far side, which is always in shadow. This is why the surface temperature of the Moon varies greatly depending on the location. The Moon is also affected by the Earth's atmosphere, which can cause the Moon's surface to heat up or cool down depending on the amount of solar radiation it receives. Overall, the surface temperature of the Moon is highly variable and influenced by a variety of factors. It is an important area of study for scientists who want to better understand the Moon and its potential for supporting\n",

It was a complex and multifaceted war that involved many of the major European powers of the time, including the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, France, and Spain. The war was fought on several fronts and was characterized by brutal tactics, widespread destruction, and a significant loss of life. It ultimately ended with the Treaty of Westphalia, which redrew the map of Europe and established the principles of modern diplomacy.

The purpose of this practice was to serve as a public reminder of the punishment and to deter others from committing similar crimes.

       " The American Civil War took place from 1861 to 1865. It was fought between the Union (the Northern states) and the Confederacy (the Southern states) over issues such as slavery and states' rights. The war began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter in South Carolina, and it ended on April 9, 1865, with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia. The war resulted in the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the Union. #CivilWar #UnitedStates #History #War #Slavery #Union #Confederacy #Abolition #Appomattox #FortSumter #RobertELee\n",

       "This code defines a Flask app with two endpoints: `/get_status` (GET) and `/prediction` (POST). The `/prediction` endpoint expects a JSON payload with `city`, `street`, and `number` fields. It then looks up the price estimate in the `price_estimates` dictionary and returns it as a JSON response. If the city or street is not found, it returns an error response with a 404 status code. You can run this code and use a tool like `curl` or a web browser to test the endpoints. For example, to test the `/get_status` endpoint, you can run `curl http://localhost:5000/get_status` and expect to see a JSON response with the status `OK`. To test the `/prediction` endpoint, you can run `curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -d '{\"city\": \"City A\", \"street\": \"street1\", \"number\": 123}' http://localhost:5000/prediction` and expect to see a JSON response with the price estimate for City A, street1. Note that this is a very simple implementation and you may want to add more error handling, validation, and security measures depending on your use case.assistant:\n",

    "* The failure with \"graphe paranomon\" was quite epic. Haluciantion at its best. As a big surprise arrived the good answer on Japanese history.\n",
    "* As expected, American history answers were decent.\n",
    "* We then evaluated code (Python), system design, more code (C++) and capacity to answer to questions with multiple parameters.\n",
    "* The questions with multiple parameters were answered with relatively good accuracy, but the answers were too elaborate, not the short ones, with bulletpoints, as we expected.\n",
    "* The task chain failing was really taking us by surprise.  \n",
    "* The final math problem - failed worst than Gemma (who rationed it's 120 Km; the true answer is 90 km). But actually the rationing is really, really wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of execution time, it is much slower (one level of magnitude slower) than Gemma. \n",
