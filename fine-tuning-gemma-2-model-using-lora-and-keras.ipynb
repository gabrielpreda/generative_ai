These models are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models available in English, with open weights provided for both pre-trained and instruction-tuned versions. Gemma models excel in a range of text generation tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their compact size allows for deployment in resource-constrained environments like laptops, desktops, or personal cloud infrastructure, making state-of-the-art AI models more accessible and encouraging innovation for all. \n","\n","Gemma 2 represent the 2nd generation of Gemma models. These models were trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety of sources. The **27B** model was trained with **13 trillion** tokens, the **9B** model was trained with **8 trillion tokens**, and **2B** model was trained with **2 trillion** tokens. Here is a summary of their key components: \n","* **Web Documents**: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. Primarily English-language content.\n","* **Code**: Exposing the model to code helps it to learn the syntax and patterns of programming languages, which improves its ability to generate code or understand code-related questions.\n","* **Mathematics**: Training on mathematical text helps the model learn logical reasoning, symbolic representation, and to address mathematical queries.\n","\n","To learn more about Gemma 2, follow this link: [Gemma 2 Model Card](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma-2).\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"707a3641","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.010628,"end_time":"2024-08-22T09:25:53.93166","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-08-22T09:25:53.921032","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# What is LoRA?  \n","\n","**LoRA** stands for **Low-Rank Adaptation**.
